But I figure that this info would be super useful for other folks; so I'm sharing this here to make it easier to access and share! It is written for trans women, but I feel the tips are applicable to anybody who wants to explore makeup.\n\u003e \n\u003e The goal of this is to act as a primer and basic rundown on important bits of theory, products, and suggestions on how to achieve feminizing makeup.\n\nSo! You want to do some makeup! Problem is that you don't even know where to start? Well I'm here to help! This guide should act as a comprehensive primer to help you get a foundation on where to start and how to figure out what you need to start exploring this art form.\n\nI'm far from an expert, rather just a trans woman who started from nothing with the help of a makeup nerd of a spouse, and learned a lot as a kind of \"public safety blanket\" early on in my transition. So hopefully I should have the right amount of knowledge and empathy to understand what it's like, and how to explain everything simply to help you start too!\n\nSo to clear up a simple misconception you might have; trans women don't *need* to specific techniques to feminize their face. You can use whatever techniques cis women use; as these same techniques are aimed to feminize their face as well. The important thing isn't to get a \"femme\" face; but to find techniques that help emphasize your best features and de-emphasize your worst. Which I will help you figure out and understand!\n\nLikewise, I will use the term \"drugstore\" in this guide. This term is used to describe products that are less expensive, and easily found in drugstore; but also places like Walmart and other affordable retailers. Though they are less expensive than their counterparts (commonly called High-End, though sometimes called \"Department store\") found in places like Sephora or Ulta; drugstore products can be just as good and effective (and if they're as effective as certain high-end products, they're often called \"dupes\", and highly sought after).\n\nWith that said, we should first start with some basic theory behind makeup;\n\n1. Find what products that match your skin tone and complexion\n2. Use techniques to flatter your eye and face shape\n\n## Skin Tone and Complexion\n\nSo, skin tone and complexion are vital to finding products that look natural; and flatter your face and skin type. So to start, we'll go over undertones!\n\n### Skin Undertone (Colour)\n\nYour skin tone is determined by your \"undertone\"; which is basically what colours 'sit' underneath your skin. You could be as pale as a vampire, or as dark as a coal; but you'll generally have a colour and shade within how light/dark your skin is. In general;\n\n- Warm: Your skin has gold, yellow, or peachy tones; and generally warm colours and gold jewelry looks best on you.\n- Cool: Your skin has pink, red, or bluish undertones; and generally cool colours and silver jewelry looks best on you.\n- Neutral: Your skin has both warm and cool tones. All clothing and jewelry looks good on you.\n\n#### How to Check for Skin Tone\n\n1. Check your clothing; if you look best in warm and autumn colours, then you have warm undertones. If you look best in cooler winter colours, then you have cool undertones. If you look good in any colour, then you have a neutral skin tone.\n2. Do you get sunburns? If you get them easily, then you likely have cool undertones. If you tan more easily, then you likely have warm undertones. If you burn and tan, then you're likely neutral.\n3. Check the colour of your veins (especially on your face and neck). If your veins look more blue, then you have cool skin tones. If your veins look more green or olive, then you have warm tones. Neutral has a mix of both.\n\n#### What to Do with Different Skin Tones\n\nBasically skin tones help you decide what foundation shade to pick and what shades to use for lip, cheek, and eye colours. I suggest the following for each;\n\n- Cool: Blues, soft pink, silvers, and cool reds and browns.\n- Warm: Reds, peaches, golds, and deep reds.\n- Neutral: Pretty much any colour will look good on you.\n\n### Skin Type\n\nSo once you got colour done; you'll need to figure out the skin type. Which is a way of saying how oily/dry it is. This is important as using the wrong products (and especially foundation) can cause your makeup to flake off, cause acne, or make your skin look very unnatural.\n\nThe basic types are;\n\n- Dry Skin Type: Your skin tends to be dry and flaky; and can be caused by your skin not producing enough oil to trap water into your skin. If your skin feels tight and dehydrated after washing, then that is a good indicator that you have dry skin. Extreme examples of dry skin tend to be eczema.\n  - If you have dry skin, it is recommended to try using liquid foundation and avoid matte formulas (as it tends to flake off and makes your skin look extra dry and rough). Dewy and glowy foundations are also recommended. It is also recommended to try moisturizer to help your foundation have the easiest time applying and sticking to your skin. (Though make sure it is fully absorbed before applying makeup!)\n- **Oily Skin Type**: Oily skin tends to be what it says on the tin, it produces a lot of oil. Your pores tend to be larger, your skin tends to be shiny, and you're prone to acne and blemishes.\n   - If you have oily skin, it is recommended to try powder foundations and try matte formulas (to balance out the shininess that the oil causes). Liquid foundations tend to slough off throughout the day. Test and research products to help your skin.\n- Combination Skin Type: This is where you have traits of dry and oily skin on different parts of your face. Typically the oiliest part is called the \"T-zone\" and consists of your forehead, nose, and chin.\n   - If you have combination skin, you may need to trial-and-error your skincare products to minimize the difference between different zones of your skin. You may need to use different products on all parts of your face. But a matte full-coverage liquid foundation may work best.\n- Normal Skin Type: You have none of the problems above. You may have blemishes, but they are minimal and irregular. Your skin tends to look healthy. Your skin can also have small and barely visible pores. You can try most makeup and skincare products.\n\n## Basic Makeup\n\nSo once you figured out your skin type and undertones. You'll be able to figure out products you'll want. The basics of what you'll want are the following;\n\n- Foundation\n- Eye shadow\n- Eyeliner\n- Mascara\n- Lipstick\nBut if you are planning on wearing makeup all day, then I also recommend\n- Primer\n- Concealer\n- Setting powder/spray\nLikewise you'll need the following tools\n- Brushes (especially a couple of eye shadow brushes)\n- A blending sponge\n- Makeup Remover\n\n### Foundation\n\nFoundation is a cream or powder that is used to even out the tone on your skin. It is what gets you that \"picture perfect fashion model skin\" that you might see in your daily life. There are a bunch of foundation types, formulations, and all with different traits. I highly recommend researching by going \"*`\u003cskin undertone\u003e` `\u003cskin type\u003e` skin foundation*\" to find guides on what kinds of foundation works best for you.\n\nAs a note, if somebody with dry skin tries a foundation that is meant for oily skin, it can look overly matte and dry. Creating an undesirable \"rough porcelain\" look. While somebody with oily skin using a formulation meant for dry skin can find their foundation \"sloughing\" off and flaking off during the day. So using the right formulation is vital for creating a natural and beautiful look.\n\nSomething to keep mind of is that some foundations can also \"oxidize\"; which means that some of the ingredients interact with the composition of your skin and the air to shift colours. Often towards a slightly yellow and darker hue. Different foundations oxidize to different degrees and extents, so make sure you try out foundations in person to see how much the colour shifts.\n\nFor feminizing makeup, it is highly recommended to use full-coverage foundation. Full coverage means that it tends to hide most of the underlying tones and unevenness. Which means it's perfect for hiding beard shadow if you have dark hair and light skin. If you have light hair and darker skin, you may be able to get by with other forms of foundation.\n\nMy recommendation for a drugstore foundation to try is Maybelline Superstay 24-hour Full Coverage Foundation. It's a liquid full-coverage foundation that I found doesn't tend to make my dry skin look overly dry; and has coverage that rivals some of the high-end brands. Only issue that I've found is that it tends to oxidize (which means that as it interacts with the air, it tends to darken and turn yellow a bit); so you may want to go a shade lighter so it evens out.\n\nAs for trying foundations, it's always best to try it in person in a drugstore. So find a shade that seems to match and dab a small part it on an inconspicuous part of your face or neck (other parts of your body may be pigmented differently, so it's best to try it where it's actually used). Even better if you can expose it in direct sunlight, as that gives you the most accurate sense of colour.\n\n### Eye Shadow\n\nEye shadow is a powder that you apply on your eyelid and surrounding area to help make you eyes look bigger/smaller and draw attention to them.\n\nAs much as I would like to give recommendations for the best colours and techniques to use, it would easily make this write up easily ten times longer. Each person has a different eye shape and colour to them individually. So instead I'll recommend a few things on how to figure out how to get the best eye shadow for you.\n\n1. Determine your skin undertone and what colours will look best with your iris colour. Search online \"*`\u003cskin tone\u003e` `\u003ciris colour\u003e` eye shadow*\". But if you're in doubt, go for a nude eye shadow palette. Every skin type looks good with a nude, and you can go from a subtle no-makeup look to a dramatic smokey eye with almost any nude palette.\n2. Determine your eye shape. Search online for eye shapes and figure out which one matches you the best. Shapes include; \"Round Eyes\", \"Wide-set\", \"Narrow-set\", \"Deep-set\", \"Downturned\", \"Upturned\", \"Almond\", \"Hooded\", \"Prominent\", and \"Monolid\".\n  - You might have a hard time if you have certain types like \"hooded eyes\" or \"sunken eyes\"; my recommendation is to go for simple eye looks and instead focus on your lips. Work with the features you have, rather than fighting against them.\n1. Once you figured out your shape, look for techniques on how to get the most flattering eye shadow by searching \"*`\u003ceye shape\u003e` eye shadow*\".\n\nThe best drugstore eyeshadow I found was e.l.f. Bite-Size Eyeshadow. It was super pigmented and came in colours for every skin and eye colour. It also rivalled my high-end eye shadow palettes for how easy it was to apply and get vibrant colours.\n\n### Eyeliner\n\nEye liner is what it sounds like, it is a product you put on the edges of your eyes to line them. It is best used to make your eyes look bigger or smaller, and can even be used without eye shadow to put together a look.\n\nJust like eye shadow, the best techniques to use is dependent on your eye shape. So search \"*`\u003ceye shape\u003e` eyeliner*\" to figure out how to flatter your eyes best.\n\nThere are various types of eyeliner, but I'll go over a couple to help you understand the benefits and drawbacks;\n\n- **Eyeliner Pencil**: Some are literal pencils with a soft lead encased in wood (or wood-like) stick that you sharpen with a pencil sharpener. Others are more like mechanical pencils. To start I highly recommend this type, as it's easiest to apply and is the most forgiving of poor technique. The downside is that the colours and edges tend to be soft and fuzzy, so you may not get the nicest wing shape if you want an eyeliner wing.\n- **Liquid Eyeliner**: These eyeliners tend to come in either a pencil with a soft brush or felt tip; or as a little bottle with a brush applicator. These make sharp edges and look the darkest/most vibrant. However they are very unforgiving of poor technique and you will likely be frustrated the first dozen times you use it.\n\nThere are a few more types that tend to be less popular, but generally the other types tend to have the same issues/benefits as the ones mentioned above.\n\nI don't have a good recommendation for a pencil eyeliner, so I recommend trying one that catches your eyes and has some good recommendations. As for a liquid, my favorite is L'Oreal Infallible Flash Cat Eye Liquid Eyeliner it's very dark and flows very easily so it tends to be easier to work with. But the killer feature is that it has a stencil that slides into the lid that is super helpful for making eyeliner wings. Line up the wing with the point of your eyebrow, and draw within the lines, and you'll have an easy eyeliner. Just be careful on the eyelid itself!\n\n### Mascara\n\nAlright, so with the complicated stuff out of the way, lets go for something simple! Mascara is just a liquid-gel that you apply with a brush to your eyelashes to make them look fuller and longer, and sometimes more curled.\n\nThere are a few types, but for now I'll just recommend a simple one to get started. Some mascara is YMMV but most tend to work well for most people and isn't as dependent on eye shape or anything like that.\n\nMaybelline Great Lash is a mascara that has been in production since the 70's and for good reason. It's cheap and good quality, and tends to be a no-nonsense mascara that makes your eyelashes look darker and thicker. Some products may be more thickening, lengthening, curling, or more waterproof. Likewise if you want something fancier, I have found most of Maybelline's mascara tend to work and look good.\n\n### Lipstick\n\nWhile not as simple as mascara, it's still less complicated as other forms of makeup. You can find either liquid or \"stick\" lipstick. The \"stick\" is the classic stick of lipstick, solid and easy to apply. Liquid lipsticks come in tubes of liquid with applicators; they are quite vibrant (usually) but also are more difficult to apply evenly.\n\nThere are two pieces of advice I would give for lipstick. One is to make sure your lips are moisturized and exfoliated (basically, rub your dry lips on a dry towel to get rid of dead skin, and let some lip balm soak in before doing lipstick). Likewise is a piece of advice when doing eye makeup. You'll either want to do a \"lip look\" or an \"eye look\"; which means you'll draw attention to one part of your face with bolder colours and dramatic technique. If you have both bold eyes and lips, you can look overly busy and clownish. For \"eye looks\" go for a subtle colour of lipstick, and bolder eye colours and shapes. For \"lip looks\" go for subtle colours on your eyes, and strong colours on your lips.\n\nWhen choosing a lipstick, decide on whether you want a dramatic or subtle shade, and use a warm or cool colour based on your undertone.\n\nMy suggestion for lipstick is Maybelline Superstay Matte Ink liquid lipstick. It sticks on your face until you want to remove it and it's vibrant as hell. It's popular in the porn industry because it doesn't budge at all, if that gives a hint.\n\n## Other Makeup\n\nI'm gonna go a lot lighter on these things as you can ignore them as you're learning makeup. But if you want to wear makeup out and have it stay all day, then do a bit of research into these products.\n\n### Primer\n\nThis is a product that you apply under foundation to help it stick better, and smooth over creases and pores on your skin. A good primer can make you foundation last all day without sloughing off or flaking off. It can make foundation and makeup look nicer, but for feminization it isn't needed.\n\n### Concealer\n\nBasically think of it as super-full-coverage foundation. It's meant to be used on spots with particularly bad blemishes or discoloration. Some come in skin tones, and others come in particular colours to counterbalance redness/blueness/yellowness. It can be skipped, especially because it can require a bit of colour theory, and can be overwhelming when you start out. But if you have particularly bad beard shadow, using a peach colour (personally I use Pixi Correction Concentrate in the peach colour) over the beard shadow on top of your foundation can help make it invisible.\n\n### Setting Powder/Spray\n\nSetting powder and spray is a product used after you've applied everything else to help it stick and not budge at all throughout the day. Like primer, it isn't needed when you start. However if you have oily skin and your makeup tends to run due to the oiliness, setting powder can be useful for helping it stay even longer.\n\n## Tools\n\n### Brushes\n\nAlright, so you can get a lot of brushes, and honestly you don't need most of them unless you're doing makeup artistry. For everyday looks you can get away with just two; a brush for applying eye shadow, and a brush for blending your eye shadow. A soft and round-ended brush for both is more than good enough; as that's all I use for most of my makeup.\n\nYou can get a makeup brush set, and drug store brushes are okay. But personally my favorite brushes that you can get at a drugstore is Real Techniques; but NYX brushes also tend to be pretty good.\n\n### Blending Sponge\n\nSo you can get a brush to apply foundation, I 100% believe that a blending sponge will do you better as you're starting out. It tends to give more even coverage and is easier to apply than a brush. 'Beauty Blender' is the high-end gold standard for a good blending sponge. But the second-best (and usually 1/3rd the price of a BB) is Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge and what I use.\n\nAs to how to use one, you'll wet the sponge first to make it all soft; and then squeeze out the sponge to make it dry. Then apply your foundation to either the back of your hand, to the sponge itself, or bushing it onto your face first and exclusively blending it out with the sponge. If it's on your hand, dip the sponge in the foundation; then in any case, pat the foundation onto your face and keep stamping it on until you get full and even coverage.\n\n### Makeup Remover\n\nMakeup remover is just as vital to makeup as any other tool or product. After you apply the makeup, it may be hard to remove with soap alone. As many products try to make themselves stay on for as long as possible. Which can cause clogged pores and other skin issues.\n\nMicellar Water is one of the most common ones, and it's just oil suspended in water to help break the surface tension of makeup products and adhere them to the water to help it become easier to remove. You'll use with either a clean cloth or cotton pads to apply and wipe makeup off.\n\nMakeup wipes also work similar to Micellar water, but have the remover saturated into a disposable cloth to help remove.\n\nIn either case, you'll need to wash your face, so get a gentle facial cleanser to wash off all of the remaining product after you use remover.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAlright, so that is the most bare-bones-but-comprehensive guide to makeup that I could write out. I skipped over some things (like highlighter, contour, bronzer, blush) to make it easier to digest. But that is everything you'll need to get started and get started looking good off the bat.\n\nThe ultimate thing though, is that makeup is an art, and even with the best tools, products, and theory; you will need to practice your skills to look the best. Some stuff will make it easier to start (which is what my recommendations were done to help with) but ultimately you'll need to get started and practice until you're happy with what you can do!\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-07T16:42:41.160324466Z","tags":["instructions","transgender","makeup"]},"/Archive/Guides/How-to-Self-Administer-Medical-Injections-Sustainably":{"title":"How to Self-Administer Medical Injections Sustainably","content":"\nThis guide is written under the assumption that you are doing Intramuscular rather than Subcutaneous shots; though the vast majority is applicable to both injection methods.\n\n## Aw Fuck, I Have to Stab Myself?\n\nDon't think of it that way! You're doing enforced weekly self-care! You're biohacking yourself to be a new and improved version of yourself! You're DIY-ing the home that is your body into one more suitable to inhabit! Doing a regular ritual, asking favor from the deity that you shall become in order to inhabit them!\n\nThe primary thing you need to make doing injections manageable, and possibly enjoyable, is to make it mentally something you want to do. Dread, hatred, fear, and any other negative feelings towards your shots is gonna cause you to have more trouble performing it in the future.\n\nPlus I will share some ways to make it easier to do!\n\n## Remember what I Said about a ritual‚Ä¶\n\nThis works especially well for autistic trans folk, but it should help even the most neurodivergent of us. But make the shot a ritual. Not necessarily a spiritual ritual, but just process where every step helps contributes to a particular mindset; though adding a spiritual component can help some folk keep a positive outlook.\n\nEverything you do during the ritual should go towards two things;\n\n  1. Making the process automatic.\n  2. Helping you become and remain calm.\n\nDoing the shot at a regular time, putting on calming music, doing self-care beforehand, and breathing exercises can all help.\n\n## Keep Calm and Carry on\n\nSeriously, the big thing is to keep calm. Your body has a natural instinct to avoid harm, and unfortunately needles have an easy way to trigger that instinct. Which is why I emphasize the need to stay calm.\n\nThere are a few techniques I use myself. First is putting on calming music. My personal favorite is lofi hip hop beats, and video game music, but use something that is downtempo and causes you to feel calm. You can also put on some video or show on your PC/Phone/TV that is relaxing and familiar to act as a distraction.\n\nSecondly, I take a big drink of water; since being properly hydrated is a good way to help make injecting comfortable. I highly recommend any other self-care rituals as well. I have heard of taking a hot shower beforehand to help relax your muscles, which will help with making your shot more comfortable. Likewise skincare and shaving can also help you feel better and put you in a good mindset. Even having a treat set aside for the end can help. I personally use Hello Kitty band-aids to have something cute to look forward to when I'm done.\n\nThird, I have a checklist to follow. A physical checklist of each step can help some folks feel more calm during the process; and help avoid anxiety around missing steps. I personally set out every part of the shot in front of me, so that I can just grab each thing I need without having to think ahead.\n\nFourth, go slooooooooooow. YMMV with this, but some folks' bodies tend to get more anxious when you try to push through a shot quickly and forcefully; making further injections more mentally taxing. For some, going fast works better for them (especially if somebody else is doing their shot); but I have heard more success from folks who go slow and relaxed.\n\n## Slooooooooooow\n\nSeriously, go slow. Even drawing the liquid should go slow. As a slow draw means fewer bubbles. Inversely, moving quickly tends to raise your heartrate. But for the shot itself, once you got everything in place (see the checklist below) you want to just gently press the tip of the needle into your skin.\n\nThen, almost using the weight of the needle itself, just softly press it in. The slower you go, the less painful it is, and the calmer your body will be for future injections.\n\nYour body will learn how to react to needles based on how it feels during needles. Getting upset, anxious, and having a fast heartrate will mean your body will repeat those things in the future. Meanwhile, training your body to recognize a needle as a calming event makes it much easier to do in the future. If you have a slow heartbeat, feel relaxed, and learn to enjoy the process; then you will do your needles with ease.\n\n### Injection Checklist and Steps\n\n[Click here for the Injection Checklist and Steps](Archive/Guides/Injection%20Checklist%20and%20Steps.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-07T16:42:41.160324466Z","tags":["instructions","transgender","injections","medical"]},"/Archive/Guides/Injection-Checklist-and-Steps":{"title":"Injection Checklist and Steps","content":"\n## Checklist\n\nYou'll need the following items;\n\n1. [ ] Your vial/bottle/ampoule of medication\n2. [ ] A syringe\n3. [ ] A draw needle (around 18g. Optional, but highly recommended)\n4. [ ] An injection needle (around 23g or 25g)\n5. [ ] A sharps container (a 2L bottle works fine!)\n6. [ ] An alcohol wipe, or rubbing alcohol and a sterile pad.\n7. [ ] A band-aid\n8. [ ] Any items needed for soothing (e.g. phone for music, water, and/or treats)\n\n## Steps\n1. Sit yourself in a calm, quiet, environment. A bedroom or living room can be ideal. Set up anything to help cause a calm atmosphere; like proper lighting, music, and moving pets out of the room.\n2. Grab your alcohol wipe/rubbing alcohol, and disinfect and sanitize the injection site (I use a particularly fleshy part on my lap, though if a second party is injecting then they may use your glutes instead). Let it dry for at least 10 seconds before injecting.\n3. Prepare your needle for drawing your medication. Unpack a syringe and needle (a draw needle, if using; or an injection needle if otherwise). Grab your vial, and draw an amount of air equivalent to the amount of your medication. (e.g. if you inject 5ml, draw 5ml worth of air)\n4. Draw your medication into the syringe.\n\t1. Insert the draw needle into your vial, and then invert it so that the bottom of the vial is facing upwards.\n\t2. With the tip submerged in the liquid, inject the air in your needle into your vial.\n\t3. Draw the liquid back into your syringe, until you've drawn at least the amount you need (though if you draw more, make sure that you purge it from the syringe until you have the right amount).\n\t4. Purge any large air bubbles that remain in your syringe into your vial.\n\t5. Remove the needle once you have drawn a sufficient amount.\n5. If using a draw needle, remove it and immediately replacing it with the injection needle. Dispose of the draw needle into your sharps container. (If not using, then continue to the next step)\n6. Pull the skin around your injection site taut with one hand, as this can increase comfort and help avoid medication leaking out. Then softly press the tip of your needle into the injection site with your other hand, and very slowly press the needle into the site. Almost as if you're letting the weight of the syringe push it in. Go as slow as you need. If you find that you feel significant pain injecting, feel free to stop and find a new spot to inject.\n7. Once the needle is fully inserted, release the skin that's taut; and then inject the medication into the site. Inject as fast or as slow as you're comfortable with.\n8. Wait 10-30 seconds to allow the liquid to settle in the injection site. Then remove the needle as quickly or slowly as you wish once you are done. Dispose of both the syringe and the needle into your sharps container.\n9. Not every shot will bleed, and good spots shouldn't bleed. But in case you do, keep a band-aid within arm's reach and quickly patch up the site.\n\t1. Likewise, some fluid may leak out of the injection site, this is normal; but if you are concerned, try pinching the muscle/fat/flesh around your injection site instead of pulling the skin and release after you're done your injection.\n10.

So instead of doing that, I'll instead write an absolute beginner's step-by-step tutorial on how to install Hugo and get your site uploaded to GitHub pages!\n\nSo this tutorial assumes you are using Ubuntu or Debian, and will primarily be based of of Hugo's own [quick start tutorial](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). Likewise if you need to work on Windows proper or MacOS then follow Hugo's [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) to get that part setup.\n\nLikewise, it assumes you've already installed git and have an account with GitHub already!\n\nSo with that said, lets get started!\n\n## 1) Installing Hugo\n\nSo first thing first, you'll need to install Hugo onto your machine. So a major caveat is that you **shouldn't** install via apt; the repos are out of date and you'll likely find issues with themes (like I did).\n\nSo the recommendation is to download via snap, homebrew, or the latest.deb archive itself.\n\n- To install via snap just run;\n\t- `sudo snap install hugo`\n- To install via homebrew run;\n\t- `sudo brew install hugo`\n- To install via.deb;\n\t- Download the.deb by going to the [releases page](https://GitHub.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and downloading the package titled something like `hugo_\u003cversion number\u003e_Linux-64bit.deb`\n\t- Go to the directory that the file was downloaded to in your terminal and run the following command;\n\t- `sudo apt install hugo_\u003cversion number\u003e_Linux-64bit.deb`\n\nWith that all done, you've installed Hugo onto your system! üòä\n\n## 2) Creating Your Site and Installing a Theme\n\nSo now you're all ready to prepare your site!\n\nSo before you go forwards; you may want to create a directory for your websites and projects. But it's up to you!\n\nTo create a site run, though feel free to replace `my_site` with whatever you want to call the folder that will hold your site;\n\n```\nhugo new site my_site\n```\n\nOnce that's done, navigate inside and initialize the git repository to allow for uploading to GitHub.\n\n``` \ncd my_site \ngit init\n```\n\nNext is for adding the theme; you can use the following commands to use the [Ananke theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) as default. If you want to use a different one then take a look at [this gallery of themes hosted by hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io) to select one! But just replace the link to the GitHub repo, directory, and theme declaration with one corresponding to the proper theme.\n\n```\ngit submodule add https://GitHub.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke \necho theme = \\\"ananke\\\" \u003e\u003e config.toml\n```\n\n## 3) Adding Content\n\nSo with that out of the way, might as well add some content to let you test the website and theme!\n\nThe default theme will let you add new pages/entries with the following command;\n\n```\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md\n```\n\nBut if you're using a custom theme, make sure to take a look at it's documentation/README.md in case it uses a different command!\n\nSo next, open the file within your website's directory `content/posts/my-first-post.md` in your favorite editor and add whatever text to the bottom of the file and that will be the first post to your new website!\n\n**BIG NOTE:** the header of the file will often feature a line like;\n\n```\ndraft: true\n```\n\nThat line will prevent your pages/posts from actually being shown when you upload your site. So whenever you complete your drafts, make sure to change the `true` to `false`.\n\n### 3.5) Previewing Your Website before Uploading\n\nSo uploading your repo to GitHub, and then having to wait for it to compile can be a lengthy and annoying process. So to speed up the process, you can instead set up a local web server to preview your site without needing to upload. The local updates automatically which allows for instantaneous previews!\n\nTo run the server, just go to your site's directory within the terminal and run the command and line and enter the command;\n\n```\nhugo server\n``` \n\nThen enter the address `http://localhost:1313` into your browser, and you should see your website! Now if you make any changes to your post, you should see them happen instantly! If not, then just refresh the page!\n\n## 4) Preparing GitHub Pages\n\nAlright, so you got the site ready. Now to host it!\n\nSo you'll need to go to GitHub and create a new public repo; now the important thing is that you'll need to name it `\u003cyour_username\u003e.GitHub.io`. Replacing `\u003cyour_username\u003e` with your actual GitHub user name. Otherwise it may not work properly with Hugo.\n\nSo next you'll run the following commands (once again, replacing `\u003cyour_username\u003e` with your actual GitHub user name);\n\n```\ngit remote add origin https://GitHub.com/\u003cyour_username\u003e/\u003cyour_username\u003e.GitHub.io\ngit branch -M main\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nThis will let you use git to upload your site to the GitHub repo now. But it still won't make the site work properly yet! For that, we need to make it so that GitHub generates a branch on your repo that actually holds the website itself!\n\n## 5) Setting up GitHub Actions\n\nSo! GitHub Actions! If you aren't familiar, it's basically automation for your builds. Often used to compile and test code on push; and in our case, we're gonna set it up so that pushing our repo will make GitHub use Hugo to generate it's own copy of your site on a separate branch!\n\nTo do this; go to your repo and select the `Actions` tab at the top. Then inside, click the link `set up a workflow yourself`. Finally copy the following code and paste it into the text box that shows up; replacing the already present code.\n\n```\nname: GitHub pages\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main  # Set a branch to deploy\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          submodules: true  # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive)\n          fetch-depth: 0    # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod\n\n      - name: Setup Hugo\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2\n        with:\n          hugo-version: 'latest'\n          # extended: true\n\n      - name: Build\n        run: hugo --minify\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        if: GitHub.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n        with:\n          GitHub_token: $\\{\\{ secrets.GitHub_TOKEN \\}\\}\n          publish_dir: ./public\n```\n\nThen click the green `Start Commit` button in the top right corner.\n\n## 6) Enabling GitHub Pages\n\nSo, for the final step. Go to the settings page of your repository; and on the sidebar select `Pages`.\n\nThen inside the following page, click the drop down under \"Source\" and select the `gh-pages` branch of your repo. Then click the \"Save\" button. It should show a banner at the top of the settings page saying \"Your site is published at https://\u003cyour_username\u003e.github.io\". Click the link, and you should now be redirected to your website! Congrats! Now you can add and edit content on your site, and your content should show up on your site each time you push the git repo! Have fun!\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-07T16:42:41.160324466Z","tags":["archive","hugo","github","website","instructions"]},"/Areas/Puppys-Failure-Resume":{"title":"Puppy's Failure Resume","content":"\nThis was inspired by a page on [Jzhao's Digital Garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume/) that likewise was inspired by a [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html) article.

However, somebody who starts without one and learns the basics from first principles have better analytical tools.

Not as powerful as the [modern powerhouses](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/macbook-pro-14-16-m2-pro-max-2023) we all come to expect. Not as slight as the [Toshiba Libretto](https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/2/4566062/status-symbols-toshiba-libretto). Nor nearly as internet-capable as your [chromebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook#Chromebase). After 15‚Äì20 years since their relevance, they are difficult to recommend for any task these days.\n\n\u003e [!definition] What is a \"Netbook\"\n\u003e Netbooks were a classification of laptop that quickly sprung up in the mid-to-late 2000s, starting with (ASUS' Eee PC)\u003cTODO: LINK TO WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE\u003e. Often around 10\" in screen size, using under powered intel atom and Celeron CPUs, and running either custom Linux distros or Windows XP (well after the introduction of Vista and Windows 7). Netbooks were successful in spite of their limitations because they filled a niche by being cheap and having long-lasting batteries. Which appealed to people who's only computing tasks involved checking email, writing word documents, and light media consumption (back when \"media\" consumption on a PC involved MP3s, DVDs, and 240p YouTube).\n\nYet, there are a small contingent of nerds who may want to revive these devices in spite of such limitations. They are just the right size between \"too small to type on\" like many palmtop/ultra-mobile PCs and the modern laptop that actively weighs you down and requires a large and/or dedicated bag. Making them easy to carry and pack in small bags (and even some purses!). \n\nMore importantly, they are also superior solutions to tablets and phones for tasks like writing and coding. As the on-screen keyboard on touch devices range from \"okay for about a paragraph or two\" to \"actively aggrivating\". Meanwhile tasks that require precision when typing (like coding) very much crash headlong into the software assistance and automation that makes prose somewhat bearable on a touch keyboard. \n\nBut even then, you can just get a bluetooth keyboard and use that to type on a touch device. So why do a contingent of ultranerds like using these devices? First, they are cheap as dirt, and they often run FOSS operating systems. So while you need to rely on an app for whichever workflow you have on a phone or tablet, you can craft and customize your workflow to exactly your wants and needs using Linux or BSD.\n\n## So, What Can You Do on a Netbook?\n\nWell, to quote Gravis (AKA: Cathode Ray Dude) \u003cTODO: GET QUOTE AND LINK FROM VIDEO WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT THE CARD THAT TURNS A WINDOWS WORKSTATION INTO A MULTI-USER SERVER\u003e. Anything you would do on a Netbook back in their hayday (2007-2012) will work great!\n\n- Listening to MP3s and watching DVDs.\n- Editing Word Documents using Office 2007.\n- Browsing the internet‚Ä¶ as long as none of the websites assume any modern web standards like TLS, modern JS frameworks, and a web client more recent than 2010.\n- Reading email‚Ä¶ as long as the client isn't web based for the reasons above.\n\n\u003e [!tip] How to find vintage websites\n\u003e If you do want to browse vintage websites, use [FrogFind!](https://www.frogfind.com/)\n\nSo pretty much nothing involving the internet. Which is a hard pill to swallow considering how much the internet is a vital part of our daily productivity. However, the majority of us own a device that ***is*** powerful enough to browse the modern web; and is capable of performing a number of productivity tasks that our ancient netbooks cannot.\n\n## The Problems with Phones\n\nYour cell phone should be capable of many productivity tasks, and is capable of browsing the modern web. However, as mentioned previously, a phone is a dreadful device to type on. But also as mentioned earlier, you can supplement it with a Bluetooth keyboard. Which is fine when you want to exclusively use an app that is used for typing, but some may not support keyboard navigation nor alternative forms of input.\n\nAdditionally, using a phone with a keyboard may still be less \"portable\" in reality. As each time you want to work, you'll have to\n\n1) Unpack your keyboard.\n2) Pair the keyboard with your phone (or plug in a USB cable).\n3) Unpack your stand (because, for some reason, very few bluetooth keyboards have a place to hold your phone).\n4) Place your phone and/or stand in a place where the phone is easy to look at while being sturdy enough to remain stable.\n\nThat last part, certainly does not describe most busses and environments I may find myself during the day. Not to mention you may need up to four items to get set up, and then pack away when you're done.\n\nMeanwhile a netbook requires;\n1) Pull it out of a bag\n2) Unfold it\n\nAnd you can be ready to be productive within moments. And when you're done you can be packed upwithin a minutes. However, that is not the only benefit of a barely-capable device.\n\nTake for example, the issue of distractions. Notifications from your friends messaging you resulting in a multi-hour drag out flame war. The urge of a quick run on a game that drains all your enegery for working. Or the result of a quick google search turning into a multi-hour wikipedia trawl. The fact that a netbook can't do many of these things, or at least do them poorly, makes the fact that you can work much more rewarding than struggling to engage in distractions.\n\nEven if you can't do some work, a netbook can be an excellent writing tool. For the same reasons \u003cTODO: Link to this fact\u003e that George R. R. Martin uses Word Perfect for writing his books.\n\n## Enter, My Netbook\n\nMy personal device was a Lenovo S10-3 that was sent to the e-waste pile at work. I had run Linux on underpowered Chromebooks in the past, using one as a daily driver for a time. So I was curious if it was possible to run an underpowered CPU \u003cTODO: Get GHz of the CPU\u003e with 1GB of RAM. I thought, if nothing else, it would allow me to have essentially a modern Neovim-powered Word Processor. With excitement I immediately went about installing Distros.\n\nBut in spite of what I had been taught about Linux, I got to learn a few more things.\n1) Small Debian based distros can still be painfully slow. As Xubuntu and Lubuntu each took multiple minutes to finish booting and become usable.\n2) I love Puppy Linux conceptually; I hate using Puppy Linux.\n\t2.1 My motivation for learning Linux was browsing /r/unixporn and so having a beautiful OS (in my opinion) is vital for my enjoyment. Puppy Linux's UI is still stuck in the pre-Unity Ubuntu world.\n\t2.2 Puppy Linux doesn't follow typical \\*nix file conventions. So installing software from source or outside it's typical package manager causes major headaches.\n3) Gentoo is terrible for a low-end netbook; it may work if you cross-compile everything from a powerful computer. But I gave up after two hours of compiling before installation was completed.\n4) The only good option I found was [Void Linux](private/Netbook/Void%20Linux.md) is great, and I would consider using it for a daily driver.\n\t- The XBPS package manger is very intuitive, powerful, and quite easy to use compared to Apt.\n\t- I love the BSD-style way it handles services (i.e. linking them)\n\t- Similar to Arch, you can start with a very minimal install, which let me build up what I needed piece-by-piece.\n\nSoon, I had exactly what I needed. Neovim, a tiling Window Manager, and a lightweight browser for the odd search query. With it, I wrote a few stories, and was able to use Git to sync and back up my writing across devices. Though I stopped using it after a couple of months when I finally stopped writing once more. \n\nBut recently I picked it back up in order to write once more after reading \u003cTODO: find blog post found on HN about using a netbook as a thin client\u003e. I tried to use it for code writing and editing. However I found the process of running Neovim and running code painful.

If only, I could harness the power of my phone in the form factor of a netbook... \u003cTODO: Write about using a netbook as a thin client for a phone\u003e.\n\n^1: This is what we call *foreshadowing*.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-07T16:42:41.160324466Z","tags":[]},"/private/templates/post":{"title":"{{title}}","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-10-07T16:42:41.160324466Z","tags":[]}}

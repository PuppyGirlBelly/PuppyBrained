# Digital Gardens, Neocities, and Internet Freedom

So some thoughts I'm having about the web as somebody who spanned between the heyday of Geocities, it's death at the hands of Web 2.0, the monopolization of the Internet by Facebook and Google, and the rise of the Indieweb.

Reflecting back at the idea of early "tech pioneers", hypermedia enthusiasts, and early web adopters; there was almost a kind of naivety. Back on the [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET), the heyday of [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet), and hacker groups on [BBS'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) a good reputation was something hard gained and more valuable than gold. Without a good reputation, you couldn't gain access to somebody's system. Without a good reputation, your abilities were dismissed and ridicule would follow. Without a good reputation, you may as well be talking into the void.

Reputation was gained by knowledge, ability, and in no small part an air of smugness that made others think you were more knowledgeable or capable than you actually were. In reality, being in the right place at the right time made all the difference.

This all changed slowly. The currency on the internet was no longer reputation. Many people blame [the Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September), however I choose to blame those who monetized the internet.

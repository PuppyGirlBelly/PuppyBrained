# Cities Are Capitalist Gardens

Gardens are controlled ecosystems, with external intervention used to ensure that they grow in a controlled fashion to a particular end.

In capitalism, cities are gardens grown by capitalists. Buildings are built to the desires of capital. The things placed inside to the desires of capital. And the services of the city are built to the whims of capital.

The more corporate control of the modern city, the more efficient the profit generation is. See the Company Town and Company Store.

A feature common of many gardens is the hostility to natural life. Insects, mammals, and plant life unwanted are violently removed. Unwanted humans are murdered likewise.

- Experiment with an extreme minimalist page. Like, it looks like an art gallery, or something out of architect's digest. 
	- Text in all small caps 
	- monochromatic, the smallest effective contrast
- Playing with imitation, like having a page looking just like the old wikipedia page. (Like in that attempt at a collar story.)

# Working on a netbook in 2023

The humble netbook, the most humble of all laptops in 2023. Not as powerful as the modern beasts we all come to expect. Not as slight as the Toshiba Liberetto. Not as internet-capable as your Chromebook. And nothing as well respected as a vintage computing laptop. After 15-20 years since their relevance, they are difficult to use for any task these days.

Yet, there are a small contingent of nerds who may want to revive these devices in spite of such.

> [!definition] What is a "Netbook"
> Netbooks were a classification of laptop that quickly sprung up in the mid-to-late 2000s. Often under 10" in screen size, using underpowered intel atom and celeron cpus, and running either custom Linux distros or Windows XP after the introduction of Vista and Windows 7. They were successful in spite of these limitaitons because they filled a niche for low-powered, long battery life, and cheap computers for people hwo needed only to look at email, write word documents, and light media consumption when "media" consumption on a PC involved MP3s, DVDs, and 480p YouTube.

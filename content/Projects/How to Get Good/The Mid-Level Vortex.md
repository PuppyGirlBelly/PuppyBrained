The phrase is taken from [Speedkicks' 2018 article of the same name](https://speedkickstk.wordpress.com/2018/06/14/mid-level-vortex/).

The basic idea is that somebody who starts with a beginner's guide is told how to act in a specific circumstance. However, somebody who starts without one and learns the basics from first principles have better analytical tools. As the latter recognize traits, patterns, and analytical tools faster and can utilize them in novel circumstances.

Meanwhile the former rely on guidance from external sources; and only learn to recognize circumstances and how to execute within the guidance they have been given.

## Personal Thoughts

I personally relate to this; partially because I can't perform under rote memorization. Instead I need to understand features and tools in order to utilize them. It is why I sometimes struggled in school, which rewards those who do memorization well.

It is also why I struggled getting into Fighting Games, as the beginners guides relied on providing second order information when you didn't even understand first principles. And by the time I finally got first principles then I lost interest in trying to learn these lessons.

## Thoughts to Follow up on

#TODO This is also something to think about with the difference between IT folks, and those who rely on IT folks to perform job tasks. And maybe to provide information on how to "get good" at technology.

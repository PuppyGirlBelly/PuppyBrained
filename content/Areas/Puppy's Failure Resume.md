This was inspired by a page on [Jzhao's Digital Garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume/) that likewise was inspired by a [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html) article. I'm writing this with the hope and intention that it will keep me humble, and remind me on how to reflect on things better.

## 2023
- Did not get a System Administrator job with an organization I wanted to join. Seems that my resume didn't get on their radar as I haven't heard anythig about it. 
	- I should get more certificaitons and possibly start a homelab.

## 2022
- Did not get an IT job with an organization I wanted to. Applied too late to get on their radar sadly.

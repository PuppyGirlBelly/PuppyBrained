#noteTaking #secondBrain

Maintaining information through time is easy, as recording and saving data is trivial. However, **the real difficulty is maintaining knowledge through time**. Having the ability to recall information that is relevant to you in spite of the frequency and usage of the information previously.

The solution is to use a '[Second Brain](Second%20Brain.md)'.

Tiago Forte suggests creating a note-first organization of your [Second Brain](Second%20Brain.md);

1. It is universal to all organizational methods, note-taking processes, and note-taking methods.
2. It reduces the overhead of maintaining and organizing notes.
3. It builds skills regarding effective writing, creative and critical thinking, and visual thinking.
4. Notes are legible and useful to others, and makes it easy to share them.

You need to write small and [Atomic Notes](Atomic%20Notes.md), which are useful to yourself in the future.

> **Future You doesn't necessarily trust that everything Past You put into your notes is valuable.** Future You is impatient and skeptical, demanding proof upfront that the time they spend reviewing notes will be worthwhile. You've gotta "sell them" on the idea of reviewing a given note, including [all the stages](https://www.thebalance.com/get-to-know-and-use-aida-39273) any salesperson has to master: **gaining attention, inspiring interest, establishing credibility, stoking desire, and making a case for action NOW.**

You achieve this by compressing the information into summaries, and including all the context (e.g. details, examples, and cited sources). However, **it's impossible to compress without context being lost**; nor possible to include context without adding information. Instead, you need to be able to know what context is vital and what can be abstracted/removed/summarized. And the solution is to perform opportunistic 'compression'. **Instead of performing this task up front (as you never know what future you will need a note for), you do it in steps each time you revisit a note.**

You perform opportunistic compression by working in layers;
0. **Layer 0 - The original text**
1. **Layer 1 - Notes**: In your notes, capture anything seems interesting, insightful, or useful.
2. **Layer 2 - Bold Passages**: The first summarization. Bold the best parts of passages, keywords, key phrases, and key sentences that represent the core of the idea being represented.
3. **Layer 3 - Highlighted Passages**: Highlight the "best of the best" of bold passages. Highlighting if the note is truly unique or valuable.
4. **Layer 4 - Mini-summary**: Record a summary at the top of the note, restating the key points in your own words.
5. **Layer 5 - Remix**: On important or useful notes, ones that spark excitement, remix them. Create a new entry talking about these notes, or a blog post, or some creative work that builds on these ideas.

With this progressive approach, **you keep all forms of context, but make the important ideas easily accessible**. Easily surfaced, and easy to fall back on the lower layers if you are missing context or nuances. Then reimport this important context upwards. Likewise it helps provide a sense of trust that you don't have to be perfect; because perfection will bubble up anyways.

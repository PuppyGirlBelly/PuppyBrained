The PARA method is a technique used to organize information that is flexbile and comprehensive.

The method categorizes information on a spectrum of most actionable to least actinoable;

- **Projects: short-term efforts** (in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind
- **Areas: Long-term responsibilities** you want to manage over time
- **Resources: Topics or interests** that may be useful in the future
- **Archive: Inactive items** from the other 3 categories

When utilizing it, do not reorganize all of your notes into this system. Instead, move all of your old data into an 'Archive' folder with today's date. That way you don't need to delete anything, and you can pull anything out if it does happen to become useful.

## Ask Three Questions

When collecting data ask yourself the following questions;

- What Project will this be useful for?
  - If none, what Area is this useful for?
	- If none, which Resource does this belong to?
	  - If none, is this worth Archiving?

> [!tip] Use an inbox
> You can use an inbox to dump things into without categorizing it, and then batch organize it on a periodic basis.

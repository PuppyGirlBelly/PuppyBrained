#noteTaking #secondBrain

Atomic notes is a note taking method where all entries in notes contain **as little information as needed**. Just the information itself and only the needed the context around it. Often used in [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) note taking systems; and [Second Brains](Second%20Brain.md).

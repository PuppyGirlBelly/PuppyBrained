# Injection Checklist and Steps

## Checklist
### Items You'll Need
1. [ ] Your vial/bottle/ampoule of medication
2. [ ] A syringe
3. [ ] A draw needle (around 18g. Optional, but highly recommended)
4. [ ] An injection needle (around 23g or 25g)
5. [ ] A sharps container (a 2L bottle works fine!)
6. [ ] An alcohol wipe, or rubbing alcohol and a sterile pad.
7. [ ] A band-aid
8. [ ] Any items needed for soothing (e.g. phone for music, water, and/or treats)

### Steps
1. Sit yourself in a calm, quiet, environment. A bedroom or living room can be ideal. Set up anything to help cause a calm atmosphere; like proper lighting, music, and moving pets out of the room.
2. Grab your alcohol wipe/rubbing alcohol, and disinfect and sanitize the injection site (I use a particularly fleshy part on my lap, though if a second party is injecting then they may use your glutes instead). Let it dry for at least 10 seconds before injecting.
3. Prepare your needle for drawing your medication. Unpack a syringe and needle (a draw needle, if using; or an injection needle if otherwise). Grab your vial, and draw an amount of air equivalent to the amount of your medication. (e.g. if you inject 5ml, draw 5ml worth of air)
4. Draw your medication into the syringe.
	1. Insert the draw needle into your vial, and then invert it so that the bottom of the vial is facing upwards.
	2. With the tip submerged in the liquid, inject the air in your needle into your vial.
	3. Draw the liquid back into your syringe, until you've drawn at least the amount you need (though if you draw more, make sure that you purge it from the syringe until you have the right amount).
	4. Purge any large air bubbles that remain in your syringe into your vial.
	5. Remove the needle once you have drawn a sufficient amount.
5. If using a draw needle, remove it and immediately replacing it with the injection needle. Dispose of the draw needle into your sharps container. (If not using, then continue to the next step)
6. Pull the skin around your injection site taut with one hand, as this can increase comfort and help avoid medication leaking out. Then softly press the tip of your needle into the injection site with your other hand, and very slowly press the needle into the site. Almost as if you're letting the weight of the syringe push it in. Go as slow as you need. If you find that you feel significant pain injecting, feel free to stop and find a new spot to inject.
7. Once the needle is fully inserted, release the skin that's taut; and then inject the medication into the site. Inject as fast or as slow as you're comfortable with.
8. Wait 10-30 seconds to allow the liquid to settle in the injection site. Then remove the needle as quickly or slowly as you wish once you are done. Dispose of both the syringe and the needle into your sharps container.
9. Not every shot will bleed, and good spots shouldn't bleed. But in case you do, keep a band-aid within arm's reach and quickly patch up the site.
	1. Likewise, some fluid may leak out of the injection site, this is normal; but if you are concerned, try pinching the muscle/fat/flesh around your injection site instead of pulling the skin and release after you're done your injection.
10. You're now done!

This guide is written under the assumption that you are doing Intramuscular rather than Subcutaneous shots; though the vast majority is applicable to both injection methods.

## Aw Fuck, I Have to Stab Myself?

Don't think of it that way! You're doing enforced weekly self-care! You're biohacking yourself to be a new and improved version of yourself! You're DIY-ing the home that is your body into one more suitable to inhabit! Doing a regular ritual, asking favor from the deity that you shall become in order to inhabit them!

The primary thing you need to make doing injections manageable, and possibly enjoyable, is to make it mentally something you want to do. Dread, hatred, fear, and any other negative feelings towards your shots is gonna cause you to have more trouble performing it in the future.

Plus I will share some ways to make it easier to do!

## Remember what I Said about a ritualâ€¦

This works especially well for autistic trans folk, but it should help even the most neurodivergent of us. But make the shot a ritual. Not necessarily a spiritual ritual, but just process where every step helps contributes to a particular mindset; though adding a spiritual component can help some folk keep a positive outlook.

Everything you do during the ritual should go towards two things;

  1. Making the process automatic.
  2. Helping you become and remain calm.

Doing the shot at a regular time, putting on calming music, doing self-care beforehand, and breathing exercises can all help.

## Keep Calm and Carry on

Seriously, the big thing is to keep calm. Your body has a natural instinct to avoid harm, and unfortunately needles have an easy way to trigger that instinct. Which is why I emphasize the need to stay calm.

There are a few techniques I use myself. First is putting on calming music. My personal favorite is lofi hip hop beats, and video game music, but use something that is downtempo and causes you to feel calm. You can also put on some video or show on your PC/Phone/TV that is relaxing and familiar to act as a distraction.

Secondly, I take a big drink of water; since being properly hydrated is a good way to help make injecting comfortable. I highly recommend any other self-care rituals as well. I have heard of taking a hot shower beforehand to help relax your muscles, which will help with making your shot more comfortable. Likewise skincare and shaving can also help you feel better and put you in a good mindset. Even having a treat set aside for the end can help. I personally use Hello Kitty band-aids to have something cute to look forward to when I'm done.

Third, I have a checklist to follow. A physical checklist of each step can help some folks feel more calm during the process; and help avoid anxiety around missing steps. I personally set out every part of the shot in front of me, so that I can just grab each thing I need without having to think ahead.

Fourth, go slooooooooooow. YMMV with this, but some folks' bodies tend to get more anxious when you try to push through a shot quickly and forcefully; making further injections more mentally taxing. For some, going fast works better for them (especially if somebody else is doing their shot); but I have heard more success from folks who go slow and relaxed.

## Slooooooooooow

Seriously, go slow. Even drawing the liquid should go slow. As a slow draw means fewer bubbles. Inversely, moving quickly tends to raise your heartrate. But for the shot itself, once you got everything in place (see the checklist below) you want to just gently press the tip of the needle into your skin.

Then, almost using the weight of the needle itself, just softly press it in. The slower you go, the less painful it is, and the calmer your body will be for future injections.

Your body will learn how to react to needles based on how it feels during needles. Getting upset, anxious, and having a fast heartrate will mean your body will repeat those things in the future. Meanwhile, training your body to recognize a needle as a calming event makes it much easier to do in the future. If you have a slow heartbeat, feel relaxed, and learn to enjoy the process; then you will do your needles with ease.

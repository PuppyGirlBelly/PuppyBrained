People are often stuck in passive content loops, which look like endless scrolling and such.

1. Cue for content
2. Craving for more
3. Response of more content
4. Reward of dopamine

We can escape this loop by "curating" your online experience. Primarily, delayed gratification. **You can save an article/video/comic to read for later time that is reserved for consumption**. Apps like Pocket, Instapaper, or Readwise's Reader are useful apps for this purpose.

## My Curation Tools

I personally use Obsidian and the MarkDownload[^1] plugin for FireFox. Likewise I use the following Obsidian plugins to aid in this;

- Advanced URI
- Auto Link Title
- Filename Heading Sync
- Local Images Plus
- Simple Embeds

# Home Page

Hello, this is Puppy! 🐶 This is a website I created to help share any information that might help other folks; and keep my ideas and thoughts organized using [Second Brain](Resources/Second%20Brain.md) techniques!

Here's some stuff I've written that might be interesting;

- [Setting Up a Personal Site with Hugo and GitHub Pages](Archive/Guides/Setting%20Up%20a%20Personal%20Site%20with%20Hugo%20and%20GitHub%20Pages.md)
- [A Beginner's Guide to Makeup for Trans Women](Archive/Guides/A%20Beginner's%20Guide%20to%20Makeup%20for%20Trans%20Women.md)
- [How to Self-Administer Medical Injections Sustainably](Archive/Guides/How%20to%20Self-Administer%20Medical%20Injections%20Sustainably.md)

## About me
I am not going to talk about myself much since I came to realize the moment I write anything about myself, it almost always ends up being factually incorrect within six months[^1]. But here is the smallest bits I will share;
1) My legal name is not Puppy. It's kind of an online handle, so please call me "Puppy" anyways 🐶💛
2) My pronouns are She/Her and They/Them 
3) I am 🏳️‍⚧️ and 🏳️‍🌈 and 🇨🇦

[^1]: This seems like a good thing, since it means I'm always growing and changing. 😊

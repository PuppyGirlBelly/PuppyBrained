> Notes from Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain: The Definitive Introductory Guide](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/)

A second brain is a repository of knowledge and resources. It is systematized to make it **easy to find and recall information** and act on it (whether it is reviewed, utilized, or deleted).

One process by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) is "CODE";

- **"Capture" any ideas, insights, and excerpts that you think are worth saving**. And keep it in one centralized place. [Curate Your Experience](Curate%20Your%20Experience.md) to keep you actively analyzing, and keep only what resonates.
- **"Organize" for actionability**. Avoid rigid categorization, lean into flexibility, and primarily organize by active projects. Use the [PARA Method](PARA%20Method.md).
- **"Distill" down to the essence**. Notice patterns and connections. Design notes with your future self in mind; fill in key terms, placeholders, and related links. Use [Progressive Summarization](Progressive%20Summarization.md)
- **"Express" your unique ideas and experiences**. Your notes will be the giants you stand on the shoulders of. Shift from [passive consumption](Curate%20Your%20Experience.md) to active creation. Use your [Atomic Notes](Atomic%20Notes.md) as small (ruseable) building blocks you create for projects. Share your work with the world (and **there is no such thing as a "finished product"!**).
